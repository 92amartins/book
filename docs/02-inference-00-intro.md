# Bayesian Inference

This chapter is focused on the continuous version of Bayes' rule and how to use it in a conjugate family. The RU-486 example will allow us to discuss Bayesian modeling in a concrete way. It also leads naturally to a Bayesian analysis without conjugacy. For the non-conjugate case, there's usually no simple mathematical expression, and one must resort to computation. Finally, we discuss credible intervals, i.e., the Bayesian analog of frequentist confidence intervals, and Bayesian estimation and prediction. 

It is assumed that the readers have mastered the concept of conditional probability and the Bayes' rule for discrete random variables. Calculus is not required for this chapter; however, for those who do, we shall briefly look at an integral.
