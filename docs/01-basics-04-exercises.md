2. **Probability of no HIV.**
Consider the ELISA test from Section \@ref(diagnostic-testing). What is the probability that someone has no HIV if that person has a negative ELISA result? How does this compare to the probability of having no HIV before any test was done?

3. **Probability of no HIV after contradictive tests.**
Consider the ELISA test from Section \@ref(diagnostic-testing). What is the probability that someone has no HIV if that person first tests positive on the ELISA and secondly test negative? Assume that the tests are independent from each other.
