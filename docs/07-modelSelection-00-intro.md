## Bayesian Model Selection

In the last section, we provided a Bayesian inference analysis for kid's cognitive scores using multiple linear regression. We found that several credible intervals of the coefficients contain zero, suggesting that we could potentially simplify the model. In this section, we will discuss model selection, which is picking variables for multiple linear regression based on Bayesian information criterion, or BIC. In the next section, we will discuss other model selection methods, such as using Bayes factors.

### Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)

Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is one of the Bayesian criteria used for Bayesian model selection, and tends to be one of the most popular criteria.
