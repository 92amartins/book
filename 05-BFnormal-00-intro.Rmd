# Hypothesis Testing with Normal Populations

In Section \@ref(sec:bayes-factors), we described how the Bayes factors can be used for hypothesis testing. Now we will use the Bayes factors to compare normal means, i.e., test whether the mean of a population is zero or compare two groups of normally-distributed populations. We divide this mission into three cases: known variance for a single population, unknown variance for a single population using paired data, and unknown variance using two independent groups.
