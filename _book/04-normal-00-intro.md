# Inference for Multiple Parameters

This chapter is focused on the extending the Normal-Normal conjugate family introduced in \@ref(sec:normal-normal) to the problem of inference in a Normal population with an unknown mean and variance.  We will introduce the Normal-Gamma conjugate family for inference about the unknown mean and variance and will present Monte Carlo simulation for inference about functions of the parameters as well as sampling from predictive distributions, which can assist with prior elucidation. For situations when limited prior information is available, we discuss a limiting case of the Normal-Gamma conjugate family, leading to priors that can be used for a reference analysis.  Finally, we will show how to create a more flexible and robust prior distribution by using  mixtures of the  Normal-Gamma conjugate prior.  For inference in this case we will introduce Markov Chain Monte carlo, a powerful simulation method for Bayesian inference.   

It is assumed that the readers have mastered the concepts of one-parameter Normal-Normal conjugate priors. Calculus is not required for this chapter; however, for those who have that backgound and would like to go deeper, we shall present starred sections with more details on the derivations.
